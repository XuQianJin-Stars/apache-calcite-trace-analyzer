# Fluorite: Apache Calcite trace analyzer
Fluorite is an interactive visual [Apache Calcite](https://calcite.apache.org/) traces analyzer.
It gives an ability to view a visual representation of Calcite traces: Rels, Subsets, Sets,
so it is possible to explore not only the best plan but also dead-end options generated by
Rules during planning.

In order to get the trace to be used as an input, run Calcite planning with TRACE logging level enabled.

It is named Fluorite because [Fluorite scratches Calcite's surfarce :smile:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohs_scale_of_mineral_hardness).
